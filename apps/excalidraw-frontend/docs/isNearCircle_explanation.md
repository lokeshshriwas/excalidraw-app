# Understanding `isNearCircle` Function

The `isNearCircle` function determines whether a point `(x, y)` is **close to the outline** of a circle defined by its center `(cx, cy)` and radius `radius`.

---

## Function Definition

```ts
export const isNearCircle = (
  x: number, y: number,         // Point we want to check
  cx: number, cy: number,       // Circle center
  radius: number,               // Circle radius
  threshold: number = 5         // Max distance from outline to be "near"
): boolean => {

  // Step 1: Find distance from point to circle center
  const dx = x - cx;
  const dy = y - cy;
  const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

  // Step 2: "Near" means distance is close to radius
  // We take absolute difference so it works for inside & outside
  return Math.abs(dist - radius) <= threshold;
}
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### **Step 1: Find distance from the point to the circle center**
```ts
const dx = x - cx;
const dy = y - cy;
const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
```

1. **`dx`** is the horizontal distance between the point and the circle's center.
2. **`dy`** is the vertical distance between the point and the circle's center.
3. **`Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)`** applies the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the **actual distance**.

Example:  
Circle center `(10, 5)`, point `(13, 9)`:
```
dx = 13 - 10 = 3
dy = 9 - 5 = 4
dist = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5
```

---

### **Step 2: Check if the point is "near" the circle's outline**
```ts
return Math.abs(dist - radius) <= threshold;
```

- The **circle's outline** is all points exactly `radius` units away from the center.
- `dist - radius` measures how far the point's distance is from that outline.
- `Math.abs(...)` ensures the check works both when:
  - The point is **inside** the circle (distance < radius)
  - The point is **outside** the circle (distance > radius)
- `<= threshold` allows a margin of error, so the point can be "near" the outline within `threshold` units.

## Example Scenarios

### **Example 1 – Point exactly on the circle**
- Circle: center `(0, 0)`, radius `10`
- Point: `(10, 0)`, threshold `5`

```
dx = 10 - 0 = 10
dy = 0 - 0 = 0
dist = √(10² + 0²) = 10
Math.abs(10 - 10) = 0 ≤ 5 → true
```
✅ Point is considered **near** the outline.

---

### **Example 2 – Point slightly inside the circle**
- Point: `(8, 0)`

```
dx = 8, dy = 0
dist = √(64 + 0) = 8
Math.abs(8 - 10) = 2 ≤ 5 → true
```
✅ Still **near** the outline (inside the circle).

---

### **Example 3 – Point far from the circle**
- Point: `(0, 0)` (center of the circle)

```
dx = 0, dy = 0
dist = √(0 + 0) = 0
Math.abs(0 - 10) = 10 ≤ 5 → false
```
❌ Too far from the outline.

## Key Ideas

1. **Distance to center** determines where the point is relative to the circle.
2. **Outline proximity** is checked by comparing the distance to the radius.
3. **Threshold** adds tolerance, making the "near" zone a ring around the circle's edge.
4. Using `Math.abs` makes the logic work for both inside and outside points.
